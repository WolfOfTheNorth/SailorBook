## 🤖 MCP Integration Workflow

### MCP Agent Coordination Protocol

#### MCP Testing Orchestration
```yaml
mcp_workflow:
  test_generation:
    trigger: "Natural language test description provided"
    process:
      1. MCP Agent translates description to executable test
      2. Testing Agent reviews generated test for completeness
      3. E2E Specialist validates cross-platform compatibility
      4. Lead Agent approves test integration
      
  autonomous_exploration:
    trigger: "New feature deployment or weekly exploration"
    process:
      1. MCP Agent explores app autonomously for 10-30 minutes
      2. Bug Hunter Agent analyzes findings for edge cases
      3. Testing Agent implements tests for discovered scenarios
      4. Lead Agent prioritizes discovered issues
      
  performance_monitoring:
    trigger: "Continuous during development"
    process:
      1. MCP Agent monitors real-time performance metrics
      2. Backend Agent investigates performance regressions
      3. Testing Agent updates performance test thresholds
      4. Lead Agent coordinates optimization efforts
```

#### Natural Language Test Creation
```yaml
nl_test_process:
  input_format: "When I [user_action], I should [expected_outcome]"
  
  examples:
    - "When I search for Alice in Wonderland, I should see relevant results with download options"
    - "When I download a book, browser restrictions should be handled transparently"
    - "When I navigate to my library, downloaded books should be visible and accessible"
    
  mcp_translation:
    - Parse user action into Playwright commands
    - Identify required test elements and selectors
    - Generate assertions for expected outcomes
    - Add error handling and edge case coverage
    - Validate cross-platform compatibility
```

### MCP Server Management Rules
```yaml
mcp_server_rules:
  availability:
    - MCP server MUST be running during all testing activities
    - Fallback to standard Playwright if MCP unavailable
    - Health check every 5 minutes during test execution
    
  coordination:
    - Only one agent should control MCP server at a time
    - Lead Agent manages MCP server lifecycle
    - Testing Agent has primary MCP access for test generation
    - Other agents request MCP access through Lead Agent
    
  data_sharing:
    - Test results shared via structured JSON reports
    - Screenshots and videos stored in standardized locations
    - Performance metrics logged to shared dashboard
    - Bug discoveries documented in standardized format
```

## 🛠️ Specialized Agent Guidelines

### Frontend Agent (Flutter/Dart)

#### Primary Responsibilities:
- Flutter UI components and widgets
- Material 3 design implementation
- State management and controllers
- UI testing and accessibility
- Cross-platform compatibility

#### Key Reference Files:
- `CLAUDE_UI_UX.md` - Design guidelines
- `CLAUDE_LINTING.md` - Code quality standards

#### Handoff Criteria:
```dart
// ✅ Ready for handoff when:
// 1. UI components have test keys
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ElevatedButton(
    key: const Key('download-btn-${book.id}'),
    onPressed: onDownload,
    child: const Text('Download'),
  );
}

// 2. Error states implemented
if (_errorMessage != null) {
  return ErrorWidget(
    key: const Key('error-message'),
    message: _errorMessage!,
    onRetry: _retry,
  );
}

// 3. Loading states implemented
if (_isLoading) {
  return const LoadingIndicator(
    key: Key('loading-indicator'),
  );
}

// 4. Accessibility considered
Semantics(
  label: 'Download ${book.title}',
  hint: 'Downloads book for offline reading',
  child: ElevatedButton(/* ... */),
)
```

### Backend Agent (Rust)

#### Primary Responsibilities:

    #[error("File not found: {path}")]
    FileNotFound { path: String },
    
    #[error("Invalid format: {reason}")]
    InvalidFormat { reason: String },
}

// 2. Unit tests implemented
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_parse_valid_epub() {
        // Comprehensive test implementation
    }
}

// 3. Documentation complete
/// Parses an EPUB file and extracts chapters with metadata.
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// 
/// * `path` - Path to the EPUB file
/// 
/// # Returns
/// 
/// * `Result<BookManifest, EpubError>` - Parsed book manifest or error
pub fn parse_epub<P: AsRef<Path>>(path: P) -> Result<BookManifest, EpubError> {
    // Implementation
}

// 4. FFI bridge updated
flutter_rust_bridge::frb(sync)]

- ❌ Feature implementation details (coordinate with specialists)
- ❌ UI/UX design decisions (coordinate with Frontend)

#### Handoff Criteria:
```typescript
// ✅ Ready for handoff when:
// 1. Comprehensive test coverage
test.describe('Book Download Flow', () => {
  test('should download book successfully', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation with proper assertions
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="success-message"]')).toBeVisible();
  });
  
  test('should handle download errors gracefully', async ({ page }) => {
    // Error case testing
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="error-message"]')).toContainText('Download failed');
  });
});

// 2. Visual regression testing
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('book-details-view.png');

// 3. Performance assertions
const downloadTime = await page.evaluate(() => performance.now());
expect(downloadTime).toBeLessThan(5000); // 5 second timeout

// 4. Accessibility validation
await expect(page).toPass(axeAccessibilityCheck());
```

## 🔄 Conflict Resolution

### Common Conflict Scenarios

#### 1. API Contract Disagreement
```
Scenario: Frontend Agent needs different data format than Backend provides

Resolution Protocol:
1. Lead Agent reviews both requirements
2. Evaluate impact on existing code
3. Consider future extensibility
4. Make architectural decision
5. Update relevant documentation
6. Communicate changes to both agents

Decision Framework:
- Favor existing patterns unless strong justification
- Consider long-term maintainability
- Minimize breaking changes
- Document rationale in commit message
```

#### 2. Test Coverage Disputes
```
Scenario: Testing Agent requires 95% coverage, implementation would be complex

Resolution Protocol:
1. Analyze business value vs. implementation cost
2. Consider risk assessment
3. Evaluate alternative testing approaches
4. Make pragmatic coverage decision
5. Document exceptions and rationale

Decision Framework:
- Critical paths must have high coverage
- Edge cases can have lower coverage if documented
- Performance impact of tests considered
- Maintainability prioritized over perfect coverage
```

#### 3. Performance vs. Readability
```
Scenario: Backend Agent optimizes for performance, Frontend Agent needs readable code

Resolution Protocol:
1. Measure actual performance impact
2. Evaluate readability trade-offs
3. Consider documentation and commenting
4. Balance team velocity with performance
5. Make decision based on project priorities

Decision Framework:
- Profile actual performance bottlenecks
- Optimize only when measurable impact exists
- Maintain code clarity through documentation
- Consider future developer experience
```

### Escalation Matrix
```
Level 1: Direct Agent Resolution (15 minutes)
├── Try to resolve between conflicting agents
├── Reference relevant CLAUDE_*.md guidelines
└── Document discussion and resolution

Level 2: Lead Agent Mediation (30 minutes)
├── Lead Agent reviews conflict and context
├── Makes architectural decision based on project goals
├── Updates documentation to prevent future conflicts
└── Communicates resolution to all agents

Level 3: External Review (If needed)
├── Complex architectural decisions
├── Performance vs. maintainability trade-offs
├── Security or privacy implications
└── Breaking changes with wide impact
```
