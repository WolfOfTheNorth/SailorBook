# Feature Planning: Flutter Glass Pane Visibility

## 🎯 Feature Details
- **Priority**: CRITICAL 🚨
- **Status**: ❌ Broken  
- **Effort Estimate**: 1-2 hours
- **Tests Blocked**: 32/39 E2E tests

## 🐛 Problem Description
The `flt-glass-pane` element is hidden, blocking all UI interactions in the Flutter web app. This prevents E2E tests from successfully clicking on buttons, entering text, or interacting with any UI elements.

## 📋 Analysis Tasks
- [ ] Examine current main.dart implementation
- [ ] Check web/index.html configuration  
- [ ] Review Flutter web rendering issues
- [ ] Identify glass pane visibility problems

## 🔧 Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Fix glass pane visibility in Flutter web configuration
- [ ] Update main.dart if needed
- [ ] Update web/index.html if needed
- [ ] Test UI interactions manually

## ✅ Verification Tasks
- [ ] Run E2E tests to verify interactions work
- [ ] Check that previously failing tests now pass
- [ ] Validate across different screen sizes
- [ ] Document the fix for future reference

## 📝 Progress Log

### 2025-08-28 - Initial Analysis
- Created planning document
- Analyzed existing CSS fixes in web/index.html
- **DISCOVERY**: CSS fixes already present and working!

### 2025-08-28 - Verification  
- ✅ **CONFIRMED**: Glass pane visibility is already fixed
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: E2E tests show "Flutter glass pane found"
- ✅ **TESTED**: Basic interactions working properly
- ✅ **STATUS**: App functionality tests now passing

### Implementation Notes
- Existing CSS fixes in web/index.html lines 35-60 are working correctly
- Tests confirm flt-glass-pane is visible and accessible  
- Glass pane blocking issue is **RESOLVED**
- Remaining test failures are due to missing test identifiers, not glass pane issues
