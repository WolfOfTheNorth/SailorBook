# Feature Implementation: Flutter Glass Pane Visibility

## 📋 Feature Details
- **ID**: 01
- **Name**: Flutter Glass Pane Visibility
- **Priority**: 🚨 CRITICAL
- **Status**: 🔄 In Progress
- **Effort Estimate**: 1-2 hours
- **Tests Blocked**: 32/39 E2E tests

## 🎯 Problem Description
The `flt-glass-pane` element in Flutter web is currently hidden, causing all E2E tests that attempt to interact with UI elements to fail. This is blocking the majority of our test suite.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
From `tests/playwright/FAILED_TESTS_ANALYSIS.md`:
- All App Functionality Tests (10/10) fail because they expect `flt-glass-pane` to be visible
- Element is present in DOM but has `visibility: hidden` or `display: none`
- This prevents Playwright from interacting with Flutter UI elements

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation
- [x] Review current Flutter main.dart configuration
- [x] Check existing MaterialApp.builder implementation
- [ ] Identify specific CSS or widget configuration causing visibility issue

### Phase 2: Fix Implementation
- [ ] Modify Flutter app to ensure glass pane visibility for testing
- [ ] Add proper semantics container if needed
- [ ] Ensure fix doesn't break production behavior

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Run basic E2E tests to verify glass pane is now visible
- [ ] Ensure at least one app functionality test passes
- [ ] Verify app still works correctly in browser

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Current State Analysis
```dart
// apps/app_flutter/lib/main.dart:72-78
builder: (context, child) {
  return Container(
    key: const Key('flutter-app'),
    child: child,
  );
},
```

### Proposed Solutions

#### Option 1: Semantic Container Enhancement
```dart
builder: (context, child) {
  return Semantics(
    container: true,
    explicitChildNodes: true,
    child: Container(
      key: const Key('flutter-app'),
      child: child,
    ),
  );
},
```

#### Option 2: Material App Configuration
```dart
MaterialApp.router(
  // ... existing config
  builder: (context, child) {
    return MediaQuery(
      data: MediaQuery.of(context).copyWith(
        textScaleFactor: 1.0,
      ),
      child: Semantics(
        container: true,
        child: child,
      ),
    );
  },
)
```

#### Option 3: Flutter Web Specific Fix
```dart
// Add to index.html or main.dart for web-specific handling
if (kIsWeb) {
  // Web-specific glass pane visibility handling
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Pre-Implementation Tests
```bash
cd tests/playwright
npx playwright test tests/basic.spec.ts --headed
# Expected: Should show glass pane visibility issues
```

### Post-Implementation Tests
```bash
cd tests/playwright
npx playwright test tests/app-functionality.spec.ts --headed
# Expected: At least some tests should now pass
```

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] `flt-glass-pane` element is visible in Playwright
- [ ] At least 1 app functionality test passes
- [ ] App loads correctly in web browser
- [ ] No regression in existing passing tests

## 📊 Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Glass pane visible to Playwright
- **Secondary**: At least 50% of app functionality tests pass
- **Tertiary**: No regression in existing passing tests

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Fix might break production app behavior
- **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly in browser before committing
- **Risk**: Fix might not address all test failures
- **Mitigation**: Focus on making glass pane visible first, then iterate
