# SailorBook Rule Books - Automated Testing & Quality Assurance

## üìö Overview
This document establishes comprehensive rule books for automated testing and quality assurance in SailorBook, designed for MCP Playwright integration and subagent orchestration. These rules ensure consistent, reliable, and comprehensive testing practices.

## üéØ Core Testing Rules

### Rule Book 1: Test Design & Implementation

#### R1.1 Test Identification Standards
```yaml
RULE: Every interactive element MUST have a unique test ID
- Format: data-testid="{component}-{purpose}"
- Examples: "search-field", "download-btn", "library-tab"
- Enforcement: Automated linting + MCP validation
- Violation: Build failure

RULE: Test IDs MUST be stable across releases
- No dynamic IDs based on user data
- No auto-generated UUIDs in test identifiers  
- Use semantic naming that reflects purpose
- Enforcement: Code review + regression testing
```

#### R1.2 Natural Language Test Writing
```yaml
RULE: All test scenarios MUST be writable in natural language
- Format: "When I [action], I should [expected_result]"
- Example: "When I search for 'alice wonderland', I should see relevant book results"
- Validation: MCP can translate to executable Playwright code
- Coverage: 100% of critical user journeys

RULE: Test descriptions MUST be user-centric, not technical
- GOOD: "When I download a book, success guidance should appear"
- BAD: "When downloadButton.click() fires, successCard.visible = true"
- Focus: User experience and business value
- Technical details: Handled by MCP translation layer
```
