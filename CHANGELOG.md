### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Flutter 3.16+ with Riverpod state management
- **Backend**: Rust core library with EPUB, TTS, caching, and manifest modules
- **Bridge**: flutter_rust_bridge for FFI communication
- **Audio**: just_audio for playback
- **Storage**: Local file system with JSON manifests
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E testing
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with multi-platform builds

### Architecture
```
Flutter UI (Material 3) 
    â†• FFI Bridge
Rust Core (EPUB, TTS, Cache, Manifest)
```

### Performance Targets
- TTS synthesis: â‰¥1.2x realtime (mock implementation)
- Paragraph gaps: â‰¤200ms with prebuffering
- Memory usage: <512MB per book
- Storage: ~1-3GB audio cache per book

### Supported Platforms
- âœ… Android
- âœ… Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- âœ… Web
- ðŸš§ iOS (planned for v0.1)

### Privacy & Security
- No user accounts or cloud sync
- No telemetry or analytics
- All processing happens locally
- Only network requests: downloading public domain books
- Data stays on device

### Known Limitations
- Mock TTS implementation (real Piper/ONNX integration in next version)
- Basic reading mode (enhanced UI planned for v0.1)
- No background audio (requires audio_service integration)
- No iOS App Store distribution yet
- Limited error handling for edge cases

### Testing Coverage
- Rust unit tests: Core functionality
- Flutter unit tests: UI components and state management
- E2E tests: Complete user journeys with Playwright
- Manual testing: Book search â†’ download â†’ playback flow

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Code documentation and comments
- Test suite documentation
